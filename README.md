# Exercism
Just a little repo for my [exercism](http://www.exercism.io/) exercises.

Exercism is a web app that provides little coding challenges backed by a test suite.
The idea is you complete a challenge by making the provided test suite pass and submit your code.
Other users who have completed the challenge can look over your code and nit-pick issues they see with your code.
It's a great tool for learning iterative design techniques and to practice refactoring.

Check out [this page](http://exercism.io/getting-started) if you're interested in getting started with exericsm, I definitely recommend it.
